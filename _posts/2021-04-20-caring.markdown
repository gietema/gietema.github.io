### EA Fellowship Week 1 - How many people benefit and by how much?

Last week I joined the [EA Fellowship](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs/introductory-fellowship/) to think more deeply 
about effective altruism.
This post contains some thoughts related 
to the reading material for week one: chapter 1-3 of Doing Good Better by William MacAskill
and the blogpost 'On Caring' by Nate Soares.

MacAskill describes that effective altruism is about [five main questions](https://earthbound.report/2016/10/10/five-questions-for-effective-altruism/).  
Chapter two and three are about the first two questions: 

1. How many people benefit, and by how much?
1. Is this the most effective thing you can do?

The book starts with the example of PlayPump. PlayPump is charity that deploys water pumps 
that uses the energy created by children playing on a merry-go-round to operate a water pump.

At first sight this looks like a wonderful idea. PlayPump combines joy with something useful. However, in practice it means that adults have to walk in endless circles to get water out of the ground.  
The PlayPump simply doesn't generate enough energy to provide sufficient amounts of water. And children do not want to play with a merry-go-round all day.
Additionally, playpumps can break down and can be difficult to repair.
The pumps are more expensive than regular pumps.  
After some consideration, it should be relatively clear that this is not one of the best charities in the world.
Nevertheless, the PlayPump project won prestigious awards in the 2000s. It got endorsements from Laura Bush and Jay-Z.
It received more than 60 million USD in funding and was able to install 1800 PlayPumps by 2009.  

Now, misjudgments like this happen all too often. And it looks like PlayPump has [changed course](https://casefoundation.org/blog/painful-acknowledgment-coming-short/) somewhat. But is PlayPump a charity you should donate to if you care about helping the most people?
We should aim to donate to more effective charities. In fact, every time we are not donating to the best projects,
we are helping fewer people than we could have helped. 

But how do you figure out which charity is the most effective one?
Most of them do not tell you how many people benefit and by how much.
They may tell you that they will buy schoolbooks or medicines. But what is the benefit of those goods relative to other interventions?

QALYs and randomized control trials have helped to answer these sorts of questions to some extend. 
They give us a measure and a method that makes it easier to compare the efficiency of different causes directly,
although both have their limitations as well.
