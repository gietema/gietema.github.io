In a previous post I mentioned that some charities are much less effective than others,
but can still get a lof of funding and exist for a long time. Would the same be possible in the business world?
Companies who do not solve a problem for their users

One thing that struck me when reading this part of the book was the similarity
with startups and the business world. In the end, all that matters for
a startup is that they build something users want.
Charities work in a similar way - they only work if they create something that is valuable for their users.
PlayPump is the charity equivalent of a hyped startup with a lot of funding that doesn't know
how to solve a problem for its users. 

However, there seems to be at least one important difference between startups and charities:
the feedback loop is very different.
Startups usually build something for users who pay for that service.
Charities receive money from donors who are not the end user.
Typical donors will be satisfied right after they have donated money.
The act of giving is what gives them satisfaction.
This allows some charities to be ineffective for a much longer period than startups.
The money can keep coming in although beneficiaries might not be satisfied.


To stop tha
It means that you need to be extra careful when deciding what to donate to.
Some charities are much, much more effective than others.
Moral of the story: we need to think more deeply when considering how to donate our money. Success stories can be misleading.
