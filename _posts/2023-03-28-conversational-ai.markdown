# On conversational AI
Last week, I learned that you can now [run a speech-to-speech GPT-like model on your MacBook](https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/1640022482307502085). 
The speed of such a conversation is not real-time as you would have when talking to an actual person, 
but that’s probably not far away. 
This got me thinking: if we can talk to a good GPT model without noticeable latency, 
would we be up for a good chat? Given that GPT knows a lot, would such a chat help us, can it coach us?


One of the lessons in Kevin Kelly's new book [*Excellent Advice for Living*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62313346-excellent-advice-for-living) is: 
'Listening is a superpower' ([here](https://www.econtalk.org/kevin-kelly-on-advice-ai-and-technology/) is a good podcast episode about the book).
True, careful listeners have the ability to uncover what’s not obvious when just reading words in a text chat.
A fruitful conversation is one where one reads between the lines,
to decipher not just the words but the emotions, intentions, and nuances that underpin them. 
Good conversationalists are experts at interpreting pauses, slight hesitations, and changes in body language.
Subtleties that GPT, in its current incarnation, cannot yet grasp. 
It is trained on text (a lot), and although that goes a long way when [learning about the world](https://youtu.be/SjhIlw3Iffs?t=1066), 
it probably means that GPT conversations will feel somewhat ‘machine-like’ (surprise, surprise). 
Maybe this is why Sam Altman [stated](https://youtu.be/L_Guz73e6fw?t=7800) he has no interest in GPT as a conversation partner. 
In a sense, GPT is like a brilliant, absent-minded professor (student?) who can tell you the answer to any question 
but has no idea if you're crying or laughing while you ask it. 


Fortunately, not all conversations are about understanding and emotional support; 
they also serve to challenge our assumptions, provoke thought, and inspire growth. 
In this context, GPT could (with the right contrarian prompts) be a potent force for personal development. 
GPT as the ultimate devil's advocate, a never-ending wellspring of contrarian perspectives and fresh ideas. 
An intellectual sparring partner that can sharpen our arguments, broaden our horizons, 
and force us to confront our own biases. In a world where we often surround ourselves with echo chambers of 
like-minded individuals, the power of a GPT chatbot to shake us out of our intellectual stupor might prove 
immensely helpful.

Approach your conversation with GPT as if it is an intellectual companion, rather than an emotional one (for now). 
GPT may not soon become the coach who pats you on the back or wipes away your tears. 
But it can be the coach who prods, provokes, and pushes you to think beyond the boundaries of your own 
experience – and sometimes, that's just what we need to grow.
